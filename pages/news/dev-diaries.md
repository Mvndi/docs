###### 6-18-2024 - This is the first update of Mvndicraft's new "dev diary" series
###### Author: Timo
In the first entry of Mvndicraft's new dev diary series, I introduce recent updates to the combat system. Key improvements include a more natural stamina depletion mechanic, enhanced sweeping capabilities for weapons like shortswords, a revamped lancing system with improved accuracy, and a shift from cooldowns to stamina depletion for bows, promoting strategic gameplay. These changes aim to enhance player experience and address previous issues, setting the stage for further updates in subsequent entries.
