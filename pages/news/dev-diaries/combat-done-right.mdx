###### 6-18-2024 - This is the first update of Mvndicraft's new "dev diary" series
###### Author: Timo

Hello! My name is Timo and I've recently joined the Mvndi development team. The Mvndi team has decided to start this dev diary series to help increase transparency and progress as we lead up to release.  

In these past few weeks, a lot of optimizations, new features, and quality of life changes have been implemented. In this diary entry, I'm going to cover changes to the combat system. 

##### Enhancements
###### Stamina Depletion
Whenever a player's stamina depletes entirely, old combat used to "snap back" players which felt unnatural:

With the new system. Stamina depletion "feels" much more *intended* and *responsive* on the client.

###### Sweeping
Weapons now have "sweep/thrust" attributes. A shortsword, for example, can now hit multiple targets. Note that this attribute is irrelevent to vanilla sweeping. Vanilla Minecraft sweeping does NOT account for custom reach values. Therefore, John took the time to code our own implementation of sweeping by evaluating nearby entities when a successful sweeping attack is performed. See the video below:

###### Lancing
Lancing has been overhauled. Lances now cast a ray from the players hand position instead of player's chest. Lances can now only be used in the main hand. Our own behavior had to be implemented due to a paper bug. See the video below:

###### Bows
Bows now deplete stamina instead of being limited by a cooldown. Consequently, bows no longer stop "glitchy". Players will be forced to manage their stamina wisely when firing bows as opposed to mindlessly firing away. See the video below.

There are many more obscure bugs and minor enhancements that, if mentioned, would make this dev diary excessively long. In the next entry, I'll cover the fixes and changes made to the Mvndi texture pack.
