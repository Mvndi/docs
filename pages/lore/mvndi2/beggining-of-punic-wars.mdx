# Beginning of the Punic Wars

In the 2nd iteration of Mvindicraft, under the leadership of the Emperor and Pontifex Maximus Dante, <br/>
the Roman Revivalist Kingdom declared war on the Republic of Carthage, with a <br/>
with a fleet assembled and setting sail for Sicily in the dead of night. <br/>

After a few skirmishes, they managed to kick the carthagininans off of Sicily <br/>
before setting sail for a lone Carthaginian outpost in North Africa. Taking it with ease, it caused Carthage, who were alarmed by the attack, <br/>
to mobilize its population to get ready for a long siege of their capital. <br/>

Dante, bringing with him siege equipment, made the preparations for a siege, <br/>
sending out scouting parties to scout the outskirts of the city to probe any possible counterattacks by the Carthaginian Cavalry. <br/>
Thus it began! <br/>
