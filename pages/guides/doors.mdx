# Doors

Doors can be created by using the `/bdm` command. <br/>
A door costs 2500 Ducats to create. <br/>

## Power Blocks

Through the `/bdm` command's GUI menu, you can create a power block <br/>
and select an `Iron Block` so you don't have to use commands every time you <br/>
want to open your door. <br/>
