# Crafting

## Crafting via CRAFTING TABLE

When crafting regular items, the recipes are either similar to Vanilla Minecraft or available in `/recipes`
However, most weapons and armors require advanced techniques of crafting.

## Crafting via BLOOMERY

- Craft and place a bloomery (place two bloomery blocks on top of each other and right click with a hammer).
- Take raw iron and put it in the bloomery.
- Once hot, take it out with the tongs item.
- Place the bloom on an anvil and start hitting it with a hammer item.
- Make a fire with a flint and steel, and throw the new hot ingots in the fire.
- Pick up the ingots with the tongs, then right click the anvil with the tongs.
- In the GUI, select what item to craft.
- Take a hammer and hit it in the circled points on the anvil.
- Take out the crafted item with the tongs, and put it in a cauldron of water.
- Assemble in smithing table (u might have to click on the items again after placing them in)
