# War Guide

## Introduction
[SiegeWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/SiegeWar/wiki/Siege-War-User-Guide) is the plugin used on Mvndicraft for player to start war/diplomacy.<br/>
Even if you are familiar with this system, it is recommended you read this whole page to understand how it works on Mvndi,<br/>
as it has been highly modified for the server's needs.<br/>
There's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raiAhk2Ru5Y) here that showcases some siegewar concepts, many of these are changed on the server so still read this page.

## Starting a Siege
Siege banners can only be placed on Thursdays, right before Battle Sessions.<br/>
You **need a nation** to attack a town. It does not matter if the defending town has a nation or not, but if they do you will need your nation to be enemies with the defending towns nation before you can start the siege.<br/>
To start the Siege, go right outside the defending town's border in unclaimed lands and **place a non-white banner on the ground**. <br/>
You will need to pay a one time upfront price fee of **5 Ducats per plot claimed by the defending town** from your nation bank and a war chest worth **25 Ducats per plot claimed by the defending town** from your nation bank.<br/>
**Once the war chest is paid the banner is moved to the defending towns spawn and the siege begins**.<br/>
Siege weapons can be placed and destroyed in the defending towns borders but other blocks cannot placed or destroyed (by attackers). Defenders have a block place and destroy cooldown. <br/>
You can only use Siege weapons during active battle sessions. (this prevents griefing while there are no fights happening) <br/>

## Upfront price / War chest
When you start a siege, an upfront price of **5 Ducats per chunks claimed** is paid to the server in order to avoid Nations sieging their allies to provide them with immunity. <br/>
Additionally, a war chest worth **25 Ducats per chunk claimed** is deposited into the siege. The winner gets the war chest at the end of the siege. <br/>

## Battle Schedules
A Siege is split in 3 1 hour-long battle sessions each. <br/>
A battle session starts every Friday/Saturday/Sunday at 7 PM UTC. <br/>

## Holding/Capturing the Banner
To hold the banner for your team, you or more soldiers on the same side need to stay around the banner for 7 minutes without dying. If you succeed, you will get added to the banner control list. When more soldiers hold the banner, points are obtained faster. Since the banner is in their spawn, defenders should always capture the banner and will always get passive points during the siege.

## Outcome of a siege
A siege has points. Actions by defenders make the siege lose points and actions by the attackers make the siege gain points. At the end of the last battle session (this means the attackers have never captured the banner) if the siege has negative or zero points the defenders win, if the siege has positive points the attackers win (if the attackers have never captured the banner it's a near 0% chance they have more points than the defenders. For all intents and purposes if the siege ends because it's the end of the last battle session the defenders win).<br/>
If the attackers ever capture the banner before the end of the 3rd session the siege ends in an attacker victory.
A siege's points can be modified by:
- Banner control. Every 20 seconds the defenders get 8 points if they have banner control.
- Killing enemies in the siege zone. Attackers get 60 points for killing an enemy. Defenders get 120 points for killing an enemy.

## [Post-War Actions](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/SiegeWar/wiki/Siege-War-User-Guide#trophy-win-siege)
Losing the Siege as the Attacker means your war chest goes to the defenders for reparation.<br/>
Winning the war as the Attacker results in receiving the war chest back and being able to choose how to annex the losing town:
- Invade it (Place it under occupation status, you are able to tax the town up to 12 Ducats per plot daily)
 To do this, place another non-white banner at the town's borders right after the siege ends.
- Plunder it (One time fee worth 50*PLOTS-CLAIMED Ducats)
 To do this, place a chest at the town's borders right after the siege ends.
