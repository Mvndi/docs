# War Guide

## Introduction
[SiegeWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/SiegeWar/wiki/Siege-War-User-Guide) is the plugin used on Mvndicraft for player to start war/diplomacy. 
Even if you are familiar with this system, it is recommended you read this whole page to understand how it works on Mvndi,
as it has been highly modified for the server's needs.

## Starting a Siege
Siege banners can only be placed on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.
You **need a nation** to attack a town. It does not matter if the defending town has a nation or not, but if they do you will need your nation to be enemies with the defending towns nation before you can start the siege.
To start the Siege, go right outside the defending town's border in unclaimed lands and **place a non-white banner on the ground**. 
You will need to pay a one time fee of **5 Ducats per plot claimed by the defending town** from your nation bank before starting the siege warmup. You will also need to pay an upfront war chest worth **25 Ducats per plot claimed by the defending town** to start the siege after the **24 hour warmup is finished**. When the warmup is finished, **the banner gets moved to the defending towns spawn.**

## Battle Schedules
A Siege is split in two 90-minute long battle sessions. 
A battle session starts every 90 minutes, starting from midnight (00:00 AM) CEST. There is always an active battle session (00:00 then 01:30 then 03:00 etc). Depending on when the siege banner is placed the entire siege could last **at most 3 hours** and **1.5 hours at least**. The siege ends when the second battle session it's in ends. 

## Holding the Banner
To hold the banner for your team, you or more soldiers on the same side need to stay around the banner for 7 minutes without dying. If you succeed, you will get added to the banner control list. When more soldiers hold the banner, points are obtained faster. Attackers get way more passive points from banner control when they have banner control than defenders do.

## Stealing the Banner
To steal the banner from the enemy team, you need to do the same thing that the enemy team did when holding it. If you succeed, your team will receive 300% of the points the enemy has obtained so far in the current battle session. (When the attackers take banner control they pretty much just win.)

## Outcome of a siege
A siege has points. Actions by defenders make the siege lose points and actions by the attackers make the siege gain points. At the end of a siege if the siege has negative or zero points the defenders win, if the siege has positive points the attackers win.
A siege's points can be modified by:
- Banner control.
- Killing enemies in the banner zone.

## Post-War Actions
Losing the Siege as the Attacker means your war chest goes to the defenders for reparation.
Winning the war as the Attacker results in receiving the war chest back and being able to choose how to annex the losing town:
- Invade it (Place it under occupation status, you are able to tax the town up to 1.000 Ducats daily)
 To do this, place another non-white banner at the town's borders right after the siege ends.
- Plunder it (One time fee worth 50*PLOTS-CLAIMED Ducats)
 To do this, place a chest at the town's borders right after the siege ends.
 If you plunder a town, you are allowed to open containers/doors for 15 minutes.
