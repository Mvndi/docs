# War Guide

## Introduction
[FlagWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar) is the plugin used on Mvndicraft for players to start wars.<br/>
In FlagWar, you need to capture chunks one-by-one until you take over your enemy's territory. <br/>

## Starting a War
Wars are started through a support ticket in the Discord. If one of the sides denies the declaration of war, the other side must show admins reasonable factors that could provoke the war.<br/>
You **need a nation** to attack or to be attacked. If the target town is not part of a nation, and stays like that specifically so they can avoid war, a nearby nation can ask the Admin team to make that town join them, under reasonable condition.<br/>
Both nations have to find a good time for the war to start, a duration for the fight, aswell as what happens to the losers and the winners, which admins have to enforce.<br/>

## Attacking a Chunk
When the war starts, you may start placing OAK FENCES on enemy chunks. <br/>
Once you placed a fence, a flag will be generated. As the attacker of the town, you need to make sure that no one breaks that flag for **90 seconds**. Meanwhile, defenders of the town have to break that flag, otherwise the chunk will be transfered to the attacker's nation. <br/>
You can attack a chunk only when it borders the **wilderness** or your **own nation's claims**. <br/>

## Counter-Attacking
If you lost a chunk, you can get it back by placing a flag and defending it, just like the attackers did in the first place. <br/>
It must also border the **wilderness** or a **chunk of yours that hasn't been captured yet**. <br/>

## Winning the War
To win the war, you need to capture the **homeblock** of the enemy Capital. <br/>
The homeblock is the chunk that the residents of the Town appear when they respawn or use **/t spawn**. <br/>

## Outcome of the War
When you win, admins will start enforcing the actions that both sides agreed on in the war ticket for both winners and losers. <br/>
