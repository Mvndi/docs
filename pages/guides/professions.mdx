# Professions

Professions can be accessed by using the command `/professions`. There are two professions each with their own respective skill trees:
- **Farmer**
  - Agriculture
  - Animal Husbandry
- **Blacksmith**
  - Warsmith
  - Mining

## Skill Points

To progress through a tree, players gain skill points by completing appropriate tasks.

- *Farmer*: butchering animals, breeding animals, breaking mature crops, and fishing.
- *Blacksmith*: mining, smelting ores, and using the anvil.

The chance of gaining a skill point is shown below where **x** is the number of current skill points a player has in that profession. See below.
