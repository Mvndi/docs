# Servers

## Aether

Generic queue server while you wait to join the survival server.

## PvP

Do `/joinq pvp` to get here. A crucible where you can fight to practice or while you're in the queue for the survival server, uses [combat](combat.md).

## Survival

Do `/joinq pvp` to get here. The main server, what the [map](map.md) shows, has [towny](towny.md), and uses [combat](combat.md). You can get through the queue faster (and get other perks) if you [give us shekels](https://store.mvndicraft.net/category/380568).
