# Massacre of Tel-Aviv
### (MVNDI 2)

# Information:
- Aggressor(s): Islamic Caliphate, Manpower: 5 (3 Heavy Infantry, 2 Light Infantry), Danish Empire, Manpower: 2 (1 Huscarl, 1 Pikeman)
- Defender(s): Kingdom of Israel, Manpower: Unknown (2 Heavy Infantry, specifically both Officers & Noblemen, Innumerable amount of Militia (many likely being child combatants))

# Summary of Events
A force of Arabs (assisted by a small contingent of Danes) encroached onto the Israeli capital, with the goal of scouring it from the face of the Earth. <br/>
The Israelis promptly prepared their defence, leaving their doors open to lull the Muslims into a false sense of security. <br/>
They ventured down into their sub-terrainian farm and sealed the entrance <br/>
The Aggressors foolishly ventured down the shaft into their future tomb, not noticing the strange ease of the invasion, or the sudden opening of the entrance into the Jew's liar <br/>
First, the pikeman dropped into the abyss, being swiftly torn to shreds by the Semites, honour bound, his Huscarl brother-in-arms chased in after him, hoping to save his fellow Dane and salvage this battle <br/>
Both were quickly overwhelmed, with no chance of escape, man after man fell to the Israeli horde <br/>
Despite the tide turning against the Muslims, the Arabic commander ordered his better armoured men to follow the Danes example and put their own lives before the fervour of Islam, <br/>
(likely not knowing that escaping said crypt was impossible) <br/>
All were slaughtered by innumerable Jews, in a brutal but effective display of their might, after the flood of Arabs subsided, <br/>
the Israelis ventured out of their bunker and into their terrestrial abode, finding a single Arab, frozen in fear <br/>
The last attacker was quickly dispatched and victory was proclaimed <br/>

# Aftermath
- Aggressor Casualties: 7
- Defender Casualties: Unknown (Due to the Horde of Israelis, the death toll is unknown, but likely between 5-10)

# Conclusion
Islamic Defeat
