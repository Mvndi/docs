# Horses
Horses are weaker in Mvndicraft than in <br/>
Vanilla Minecraft. These are the max horse stats: <br/>
- Jump Height: `2 blocks`
- Speed: `10 blocks per sec`
- Health: `10 hearts`

# Roads
You can create gravel paths from city to city and <br/>
your horse will walk faster on gravel (usually up to `50%` more speed).
