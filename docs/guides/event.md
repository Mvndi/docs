# Siege Event

Mvndicraft will be hosting a siege event on the <br/>
DAYth of MONTH at XX:XX EST / XX:XX GMT. Read below for more information. <br/>

# Information

IP: `mc.mvndicraft.net` <br/>
VERSION: `1.19.4` <br/>
SERVER: `/queue siege_event`<br/>

# Introduction

In this event, there are 2 sides: The Sultanate of Rum <br/>
and the Byzantine Empire, who has to defend their palace in Anatolia <br/>
at all costs. <br/>

## Picking a Team
When you join the server, you will be greeted by two NPCs. You must click <br/>
the one that's associated to the team you want to join. <br/>
`WARNING:` You can only do this once! <br/>
`WARNING:` Do not ask staff to transfer you to the other team during the event! <br/>

# Weaponry
You are able to get weapon kits using the `/getkit <name>` command after joining a town. <br/>
Use the TAB key while typing the kit name to see all available options, or simply send `/getkit`.

# Objectives
Based on your team, you have 3 objectives you need to defend/capture. <br/>
These are:
 - The Roman Walkway Checkpoint
 - The Palace Gate
 - The Tzemiskion Palace

# Conquering chunks

To conquer chunks, you must stand on them above ground level and lower their HP so. <br/>
Once a chunk's HP has been lowered to 0, you can continue attacking further into the base <br/>
until you reach a homeblock! <br/>

Capturing a HomeBlock means the objective it belongs to has fallen. <br/>

To defend/heal chunks, also stand on them. <br/>

## Defending (FOR BYZANTINES)
When playing as the defender of the Byzantine Empire, you must make sure your enemies do not <br/>
capture the Walkway checkpoint. If they do, you still have the Palace and gate to defend. <br/>
If the gate is taken, you have one last chance to defend the Palace, otherwise your team will lose. <br/>

## Attacking (FOR RUM)
When playing as the attacker in the siege, you must capture the checkpoints in the order they are listed <br/>
on the "Objectives"  subcategory. 


# Useful Commands
 - `/towny war hud` - Show status of your war, including the chunk you're standing to (if valid).
 - `/towny map hud` - Show a minimap scoreboard of Checkpoint claims. (it is very useful for attackers)
 - `/getkit <name>` - Pick a kit that you have access to, and use the weapons to defend yourself. (press TAB)
