# Getting Started

- Upon joining the server (using a 1.19.4 client), the resource pack will be loaded automatically. If it does not, go back to the Multiplayer tab, edit the Mvndicraft server and set the `Server resource pack` to Enabled.

- You can locate yourself on the live map through `/map`. After connecting your Minecraft account to the map, you will see your player icon. You can use `/rtp` while in the spawn (aether) to teleport to a random location.

- To create a town, find a good spot and type `/town new NAME`. It will ask you to pay 1000 Ducats, the currency of the server which can be obtainted by killing animals, mining ores, and farming crops.

- To check how much money you have, use `/money`. You can pay other players your money with `/money give PLAYERNAME AMOUNT`. For example: `/money pay Notch 123`.

- After the town is created you can build, wage wars, or found a nation. Check the [Towny Wiki](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works) for a full guide on Towny.

- To get weapons, armor, shields, etc; you need to type `/recipes` where you will find all custom recipes on the server.
