Siege weapons are emplacements designed to destroy enemy fortifications and control areas of the battlefield.

# Obtaining
All siege weapons, and their ammunition, can be obtained from `/mshop`. (the new /guishop) <br></br>
To place a siege weapon, right click an area on the ground to place it. They require a certain area around the location to be clear of blocks and entities before they can be placed. <br></br>
To pick up a siege weapon which has been placed, break the block underneath it. <br></br>
To pick up a siege weapon after a server restart, right click the siege weapon, and it will be turned back into an item.
