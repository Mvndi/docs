Welcome back mvndibros to our weekly dev log for Mvndicraft.
Thank you all for following the development as always, let’s jump right into this.
Today we’ll be talking about the various visual improvements that were made to our texture pack thanks to our builders, without whom a lot of this feedback could not have been taken into account.
This rework of our assets is still ongoing and spearheaded entirely by our head pixel artist Ninjafrito who’s been hard at work delivering some of the best pixel art out there in terms of minecraft servers.
First off our various improved UI elements, aesthetics has always been an important part of the server’s identity when it comes to creating immersion for the player, here are a few examples of some of Ninja’s excellent work.

## Why did we do this rework?

Well, we always wanted to achieve a unified aesthetic when it came to immersing the player, with mvndi being as old as it is a lot of placeholder assets ended up staying for a long time.
A large number of them didn’t truly feel medieval when it came to the aesthetic, we want players to be as immersed as possible visuals and sound are key in this department.
Armors were one of the biggest offenders and featured assets from a myriad of others projects which we had with permission and are grateful for but our server’s evolution has been long overdue.

## Armor Trims

Featured in this image are some of the armor trims (extreme pain in the ass to work on) which will be usable on the server to further decorate your kit.
This will extended to a variety of armors like cuirass, gambeson, tabarded hauberk and full plate.

## Armor Finishes

There will also be variants of metal armors which will have different types of finishes.
There will be a variety to follow historically accurate examples.

- Gold
- Brass
- Blackened (achieved through use of acid or burning the armor)
- Russeted (rusting coat done to protect the armor)
- Blued

## Major block rework

Our blocks were a massive mix and match of models and textures which didn’t mesh together and made for a pretty but quite incoherent aesthetic.
Now it is no longer the case since we’ve overhauled.
Glass, sandstone, terracotta, pillars, special blocks, glazed terracottas have been reworked to function alongside Excalibur.
