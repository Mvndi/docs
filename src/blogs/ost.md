# Mvndi Soundtrack Blog

Greetings Mvndibros, for this special occasion, I, the Mvndi soundtrack composer, [Alhassan](https://www.youtube.com/@AlhassanComposer), am here to speak about all things music. I am excited to introduce you to our meticulously researched, and relentlessly crafted original soundtrack that will be present in-game. It features a wide array of musical styles from epic orchestral scores in sieges and cinematics to historically accurate regional music based on documented traditions and folklore of the time for the most immersive medieval experience. Let's take a look over Mvndi's musical soundscapes.

## The Music

### Main Theme

To kick things off strong, the main theme Journey of the Marbleborn is a grandiose orchestral epic that encompasses the game's premise; to make you truly feel like a lord at war. This track will be featured in the server's intro cinematic.

### Regional Themes

The bread and butter of the OST that will accompany you throughout most of your gameplay. It covers regions such as: Byzantium, Italy, Andalusia, Eastern Europe and the Abbasid Empire to name a few of the geographies covered by the music. I strived to be as historically accurate as possible, maintaining each region's respective traditions and distinct culture in terms of musical instruments used and how they were played at the time. Months went just into researching and referencing historical sources such as manuscripts and reconstructions, basing the music on primary sources whenever possible. However, oftentimes, such manuscripts were hard to come by as it was a rarity for certain cultures to write or document music in the medieval period, opting to preserve tradition orally from one generation to the next; which is where educated historical guesses and references to folklore took place when composing some of these themes. A lot of these tracks feature live recorded percussion instruments including frame drums, various leather hand drums, and tambourines, while others included live melodic instruments like the _Oud_.

### Combat Themes

- Duels

  Music that matches the fast paced clutch of PvP and PvE duels with each region having a distinct flare, from Northern Europe's blaring war horns to the Arabian peninsula's mesmerizing war drums.
- Naval combat

  Warfare at sea has distinct music too, reflecting the painstaking effort it takes to sink a ship.
- Siege combat

  Sieges feature a unique set of adrenaline-rushing tracks that play at certain points in a battle.
- Special events

  Each in-game cutscene is accompanied by a score such as a victory or defeat theme in special event sieges or a nation being created, a town resident being added or kicked etc.
