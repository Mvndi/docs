# Mvndicraft IV dev log 1

Welcome back mvndibros it has indeed been a long while. We have been quietly working away towards finishing the server and we can confidently say that the release will be soon.

We made sure to overhaul and rust off older systems which hadn't been up to speed in the last iterations.

Today we would like to present our finished ships and the various mechanics that they will bring to the table since they are a game changer when it comes to sieges and trade.

Ships are a system which might as well be its own game at this point as their level of customisation is quite advanced we will be showing off their various features in this dev log.

A lot of what's talked about in this blog has more information which can be found on the [Boat](../boats/boats.md) page

They bring new gadgets to the table like harpoons and greek fire grenades which were invented around the 7<sup>th</sup> century by the byzantines. They are a defensive impact grenade which will allow players to defend their walls and damage enemy vessels.

Ramming:

Ships have access to ramming without any upgrades but it causes quite a bit of damage to your own ship without the proper upgrades.

We have the drum upgrade which provices an ability (with cooldown) that temporarily increases the ship's speed proportionally to the amount of rowers you have.

The ram can also be installed at the front of a ship in order to cause even more damage to the ship being rammed and decrease the damage taken by the ramming ship.

Shield mounts upgrade:

Aside from being a lovely form of historically accurate decoration it will add a health bonus to the ship. Any type of mvndi shield can be installed on the ship.

Storage:

Ships have a certain amount of storage which you will be able to access when the ship is docked.

You will also be able to place horses inside the storage in order to launch amphibious assaults on enemy cities.
