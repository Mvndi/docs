# Trebuchet

The trebuchet is a highly adjustable siege weapon with a large area of effect.

## Adjusting

The range of the trebuchet is adjusted by right clicking the counterweight with cobblestone to add range, or left clicking to subtract range. Each piece of cobblestone adds about 10 blocks to the range.

The trebuchet can be rotated by sneaking and left or right clicking the back to adjust the yaw.

## Loading

To load the trebuchet, first right click the back of the trebuchet to lower the arm. Then, once the arm has reached its lowest extent and the ropes attach, load a boulder by right clicking the back with a boulder in your main hand. You will not be able to adjust the range of the trebuchet once the arm has begun to lower.

## Firing

Once the trebuchet is loaded, left click the back of the trebuchet to launch the stone.

(Loading animation is sped up for brevity. In reality, it takes 5 times as long to load.)
