# Siege Weapons

Siege weapons are emplacements designed to destroy enemy fortifications and control areas of the battlefield.

## Obtaining

All siege weapons, and their ammunition, can be crafted (see `/recipes`)
To place a siege weapon, right click an area on the ground to place it. They require a certain area around the location to be clear of blocks and entities before they can be placed.
To pick up a siege weapon which has been placed, break the block underneath it.
To pick up a siege weapon after a server restart, right click the siege weapon, and it will be turned back into an item.

Blocks which name contains a word in this list or which name is a word in this list are 2 times more resistent to siege weapons like the [Cannon](./cannon.md) and [Trebuchet](./trebuchet.md):

- "BRICKS"
- "STONE"
- "GRANITE"
- "ANDESITE"
- "DIORITE"
- "CONCRETE"
- "DEEPSLATE"
- "STONE_BRICKS"
- "TERRACOTTA"
- "SANDSTONE"
- "QUARTZ"

For example, "Polished Diorite" is more resistent than a block named "Dirt".

Siege weapons only break blocks during active battle sessions to prevent griefing while there are no fights happening, see [War](../war.md)
