# Combat

1. Combat in Mvndicraft is more deliberate than in vanilla Minecraft.
2. Timing, stamina, poise, and your loadout all influence how fights play out. Spamming attacks or blocking recklessly can lead to negative consequences.

## Stamina

Stamina governs all actions in combat. Attacking, sprinting, blocking with a shield, and sprint-jumping consume stamina.

- Regular jumping does **not** consume stamina.
- Crossbows and firearms do **not consume stamina under any circumstances**.
- Blocking that depletes your stamina will stagger you.
- Holding up your shield (holding the block button) slows stamina regeneration.
- Stamina recovers only when standing still or moving without sprinting.

Combat requires timing and conservation; spamming actions leaves you vulnerable.

## Weight

Armor, weapons, and shields have weight. Heavy load slows movement and may prevent swimming.

Balance mobility and protection. Item descriptions list weight.

## Poise, Stagger, and Critical Damage

Armor provides poise, a measure of how much force you can absorb before staggering.

- Poise takes time to reset after taking a hit (up to 5 seconds), but each piece of armor reduces the time taken.
- If a hit exceeds your poise threshold, you stagger.
- Being staggered leaves you vulnerable: any hit received while staggered deals critical damage.
- Stagger can occur from blocking that depletes stamina or taking repeated hits.

## Attack and Defense Types

Weapons deal specific types of damage: thrust, strike, slash, or regular. Armor provides protection differently against each type.

Shields reduce damage but consume stamina. Blocking or attacking without considering poise leaves you vulnerable.

## Attributes and Stats

Players have attributes such as strength, dexterity, vitality, and endurance. Weapons and shields may have **attribute requirements**; using them without meeting those reduces effectiveness.

Weapons may also provide **bonuses for strength and dexterity**, increasing damage for players with higher corresponding attributes.

Attributes affect damage, stamina, and defense. Every choice matters.

## Damage and Defense

Damage depends on weapon, attributes, armor, and shields. Small attacks are partially absorbed; stronger attacks penetrate.

- Shields reduce damage but consume stamina.
- Poise determines if a hit will stagger you.
- Hits taken while staggered deal critical damage.
- Attack type, armor type, shield, and poise interact to determine the final outcome.

## Weapon, Shield, and Armor Trade-offs

- Heavy weapons deal more damage but are slower.
- Light weapons strike faster but may be less effective against heavy armor.
- Shields reduce damage but consume stamina, slow stamina regeneration, and can fail if overused or poise is broken.
- Armor increases defense and poise but slows movement.

Every choice carries a cost. Combat is about weighing trade-offs and timing actions.

## Throwing Weapons

Throwing weapons allow ranged attacks but leave your hand empty afterward. Timing and accuracy are critical.

## Tips

- Monitor your stamina carefully. Attacking, sprinting, or blocking recklessly will leave you vulnerable.
- Shields reduce damage but consume stamina, and blocking that fully depletes stamina will stagger you. Holding your shield continuously also slows stamina regeneration.
- Being staggered is dangerous: any hit received while staggered deals critical damage.
- Crossbows and firearms do **not consume stamina under any circumstances**.
- Weapons may provide bonuses for strength or dexterity; higher attributes increase their effectiveness.
- Choose your loadout wisely: being too heavy, too light, or overly focused in one stat area can leave you at a disadvantage.
