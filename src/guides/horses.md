# Horses

Golden carrots and apples are disabled. You can breed horses with hay bales instead.

Ice roads are banned in the rules.

You can create paths to increase mounts speed instead:
- **Gravel** increase horse, donkey and mule speed by 30%.
- **Suspicious gravel** increase horse, donkey and mule speed by 50%.
- **Sand** slow down horse, donkey and mule by 30% but increase camel speed by 20%.
- **Suspicious sand** make camels faster by 40%

Suspicious gravel & sand can be craft by adding stone & sandstone to gravel & sand respectively. Check blocks recipes ingame `/recipes`.

Horse & Camel stats have been limited:
- Jump: 1.4 to 1.5 blocks (A fence height)

Hitting other players or mobs with a horse does trample damage to the players or mobs if your riding fast enough.
