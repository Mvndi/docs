# Starting a Siege

Siege banners can only be placed on Fridays, right before Battle Sessions.

- You **need a nation** to attack a town. It does not matter if the defending town has a nation, but if they do, your nation must be enemies with the defending town's nation before you can start the siege.
- Your nation bank needs enough money to pay both:
  1. A declaration fee of **5 Ducats per plot claimed by the defending town** from your nation bank.
  2. A war chest worth **25 Ducats per plot claimed by the defending town** from your nation bank.
- To start the siege, go right outside the defending town's border in unclaimed lands and **place a non-white banner on the ground**.

**Once the war chest is paid, the banner is _MOVED TO THE DEFENDING TOWN'S SPAWN_ and the siege begins.**

- Siege weapons can be placed and destroyed in the defending town's claims, but other blocks cannot be placed or destroyed (by attackers).
- Defenders have a 60-second block place and destroy cooldown, which also applies to attackers in the surrounding wilderness chunks of the defending town (attackers cannot build/destroy inside the defending town; only siege weapons can break blocks in the defending town).
- Siege weapons only break blocks during active battle sessions to prevent griefing when no fights are happening.

## Upfront Price / War Chest

When you start a siege, an upfront price of **5 Ducats per chunk claimed** is paid to the server to prevent nations from sieging their allies to provide immunity.
Additionally, a war chest worth **25 Ducats per chunk claimed** is deposited into the siege. The winner receives the war chest at the end of the siege.
