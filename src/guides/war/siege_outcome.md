# Outcome of a Siege

A siege has points. Actions by defenders make the siege lose points, and actions by attackers make the siege gain points. At the end of the last battle session, if the siege has negative or zero points, the defenders win. If the siege has positive points, the attackers win (if the attackers have never captured the banner, it's nearly impossible for them to have more points than the defenders, so defenders typically win in this case). If the attackers capture the banner before the end of the second session, the siege ends in an attacker victory.

A siege's points can be modified by:

- **Banner control**: Every 20 seconds, defenders get 8 points if they have banner control. Stand within 8 blocks of the banner on the same y-level for 7 minutes to be added to banner control (you will see a timer and messages in chat).
- **Killing enemies in the siege zone**: Attackers get 60 points for killing an enemy. Defenders get 120 points for killing an enemy. (Attackers should not win a siege unless they take the defending town's spawn.)

## Post-War Actions

Losing the siege as the attacker means your war chest goes to the defenders for reparation.
Winning the war as the attacker results in receiving the war chest back and being able to choose how to annex the losing town:

- **Invade it**: Place the town under occupation status, allowing you to tax the town up to 12 Ducats per plot daily. To do this, place another non-white banner at the town's borders right after the siege ends.
- **Plunder it**: Receive a one-time fee worth 50 Ducats per plot claimed. To do this, place a chest at the town's borders right after the siege ends.
