# Siege Camps

Siege camps replace general spawning for attackers during a siege and provide a temporary base for the attacking nation.

- **Setup**: On Fridays, when wars are declared, attackers may set up a siege camp outside the defending town by placing a bed in the desired chunk. The siege camp is a temporary one-chunk claim granted to the attacking nation for up to 48 hours (until the end of the weekend). If not captured, the claim is removed after this time.
- **Location**: The siege camp must be placed at least 2 chunks away from the defending town’s borders but no farther than 16 chunks.
- **Features**: The siege camp includes a banner with a fake beacon visible to players in the siege zone. Particles display a 4-block radius around the banner to indicate the capture area. Allies and members of the attacking nation can access the siege camp and teleport to it using a command, with a 10-second cooldown between teleports.
- **Respawn**: On death, attackers respawn at the nearest permitted siege camp. If the player’s town is closer than the siege camp, they will respawn at their town instead.
- **Capture**: The defending town can capture the siege camp by standing within a 4-block radius of the banner on the same y-level for 60 seconds. If the banner is captured, the siege camp is removed, and attackers can no longer reclaim it for that siege.
- **Post-Siege**: If the attacking nation captures the defending town, the siege camp remains until its 48-hour timer expires, and defenders can no longer capture it. This allows attackers to travel to the captured town for roleplay purposes.
