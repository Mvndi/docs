# Battle Sessions

A siege is split into two 2-hour-long battle sessions.
A battle session starts every Saturday and Sunday at 6:30 PM UTC.

You can see when the next battle session is with the `/sw nextsession` command.

## Holding/Capturing the Banner

To hold the banner for your team, you or more soldiers on the same side need to stay within 8 blocks of the banner on the same y-level for 7 minutes without dying (you will see a timer and messages in chat). If you succeed, you will be added to the banner control list. People who are standing close enough to the banner to be eligible for banner control will have a glowing effect, making them visible through walls. After someone is added to banner control, they can leave; they don't have to stay there. If you do `/t <besieged town>` and hover over where it says `[Sieged]`, you can see who's in the banner control list. When more soldiers hold the banner, points are obtained faster. Since the banner is in their spawn, defenders should always capture the banner and will gain passive points during the siege.
