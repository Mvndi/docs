# Battle Sessions

A siege is split into two 2-hour-long battle sessions.
A battle session starts every Saturday and Sunday at 6:30 PM UTC.

You can see when the next battle session is with the `/sw nextsession` command.

## Holding/Capturing the Banner

Control the siege banner to gain points for your team. Defenders typically hold the banner since it’s at their spawn, earning passive points during the siege.

### How to Capture

- **Requirement**: Stand within 8 blocks of the banner on the same y-level for 7 minutes without dying.
- **Indicators**:
  - A timer and chat messages show your progress.
  - Eligible players glow, visible through walls.
- **Outcome**: Once captured, you’re added to the banner control list and can leave the area.

### Banner Control Details

- **Check Control List**: Use `/t <besieged town>` and hover over `[Sieged]` to see the list.
- **Point Boost**: More soldiers controlling the banner earn points faster.
- **Defender Advantage**: The banner’s location at the town’s spawn makes it easier for defenders to hold. If the attackers ever capture the banner at any point the attackers win the siege.
