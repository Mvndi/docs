# War Introduction

[SiegeWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/SiegeWar/wiki/Siege-War-User-Guide) is the plugin used on Mvndicraft for players to start war/diplomacy.
Even if you are familiar with this system, it is recommended you read all related war guides to understand how it works on Mvndi, as it has been highly modified for the server's needs.
There's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raiAhk2Ru5Y) that showcases some SiegeWar concepts, but many of these are changed on the server, so please read all war-related guides.

## War Miscellaneous

- [Cannons](./siege_weapons/cannon.md) are better for precise strikes, while [Trebuchets](./siege_weapons/trebuchet.md) are better at breaking many blocks.
- Greek fire burns berry bushes.
