# War Sickness

If you are not allied with or part of the participating towns/nations and you enter a siege zone during a battle session, you will get war sickness. This is to prevent third-party interference. You also need a military rank to avoid siege sickness. If you only have a town, then the mayor, co-mayor, or assistant should assign the `Guard` rank. If you're in a nation, then your king, co-king, or assistant should assign the `Private` rank.

**Town Military Ranks:**

- Guard

**Nation Military Ranks:**

- Private
- Sergeant
- Lieutenant
- Captain
- Colonel
- General

You can also pay your soldiers with `/sw nation paysoldiers <amount>`.
