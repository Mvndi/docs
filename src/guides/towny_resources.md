## What is Towny Resources?

Towny Resources is a towny extension that allows towns to generate
resource income.

## How do i use towny Resources?

You start by surveying with the command `/t resource survey`. This will add a resource to your towns
production and will allow you to collect the income 1. per towny day.
Each consequent survey will be more expensive.
The prices are: 250, 1000, 5000, 20000. Each survey also requires a certain town size (in chunks): 10, 50, 100, 200.
You also need enough players in your town to harvest your found resources. The player requirement is: 1, 6, 14, 24.
The following table provides an overview of the levels:

You can see the resources production of a town with `/t <town name>` or look on the map
