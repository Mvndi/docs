# Big Doors

Doors can be created by using the `/bdm` command.

There's a video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYnM5divwN4)

## Power Blocks

Through the `/bdm` command's GUI menu, you can create a power block
and select a `Gearbox` so you don't have to use commands every time you
want to open your door.
