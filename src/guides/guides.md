# Guides

<!-- The guides on this website are temporary, more complete but in progress guides can be found on <https://wiki.mvndicraft.net> -->

## Getting Started

- Upon joining the server (using a 1.21.11 client), the resource pack will be loaded automatically. If it does not, go back to the Multiplayer tab, edit the Mvndicraft server and set the `Server resource pack` to Enabled.
- You can locate yourself on the [live map](https://map.mvndicraft.net) with `/map show`. After connecting your Minecraft account to the map, you will see your player icon. You can use `/rtp` to teleport to a random location and hide yourself on the map with `/map hide`.
- To create a town, find a good spot and type `/town new <name>`. It will ask you to pay 1000 Ducats, the currency of the server which can be obtainted by killing animals, mining ores, and farming crops.
- To check how much money you have, use `/money`. You can pay other players your money with `/money pay <name> <amount>`.
- After the town is created you can build, wage wars, or found a nation. Check the [Towny Wiki](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works) for a full guide on Towny.
- To get weapons, armor, shields, etc; you need to type `/recipes` where you will find all custom recipes on the server.
- Use the menu item in the last hotbar slot to open the player information menu (or run /menu). To disable the item, run /togglemenuitem

### how do i get money?

smelt, kill stuff, fish, mine, etc

### profession xp tldr?

farming gives u farming profession xp
hunting and breeding gives herdsman profession xp
smelting gives blacksmith profession xp (like when u remove from furnace)
mining gives miner profession xp
fishing gives seaman profession xp so does riding in a boat and killing fish and swimming in river/ocean/beach biome also gives seaman profession xp

when u do these its rng for if u like get xp (shows % in hud) but the higher ur level the lower the chance, low level sohuld be like almost garunteed

profession xp is sent in chat msg, whenever u do a thing that gives u money (listed above) it increases ur progress towards a level up, the higher ur level the lower chance u have to make progress towards leveling up

### attribute xp?

the level up and experience in the action bar (above hotbot) is for `/attributes` and you can upgrade your health/stamina/etc here
only pve combat activites get u attribute xp
most mobs like horses aren't garunteed to give attribute xp and it's low amount
boars/bears/wolves/bandits are garunteed to give attribute xp and give a lot more compared to other mobs

action bar xp (normal minecraft xp bar) -> `/attributes` xp
chat msg xp  (hud % next to profession icon, left of hotbar) -> `/professions` xp

### I placed boat and it's not moving

it's probably under construction do `/modifyship` while looking at it and you can see the initial construction timer, it will undock after this and be usable
