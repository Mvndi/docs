# Guides

The guides on this website are temporary, more complete but in progress guides can be found on <https://wiki.mvndicraft.net>

## Getting Started

- Upon joining the server (using a 1.21.4 client), the resource pack will be loaded automatically. If it does not, go back to the Multiplayer tab, edit the Mvndicraft server and set the `Server resource pack` to Enabled.
- You can locate yourself on the [live map](https://map.mvndicraft.net) with `/map show`. After connecting your Minecraft account to the map, you will see your player icon. You can use `/rtp` to teleport to a random location and hide yourself on the map with `/map hide`.
- To create a town, find a good spot and type `/town new <name>`. It will ask you to pay 1000 Ducats, the currency of the server which can be obtainted by killing animals, mining ores, and farming crops.
- To check how much money you have, use `/money`. You can pay other players your money with `/money pay <name> <amount>`.
- After the town is created you can build, wage wars, or found a nation. Check the [Towny Wiki](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works) for a full guide on Towny.
- To get weapons, armor, shields, etc; you need to type `/recipes` where you will find all custom recipes on the server.
- Use the menu item in the last hotbar slot to open the player information menu (or run /menu). To disable the item, run /togglemenuitem
